# What are the potential benefits of Blockchain in Healthcare?
This is my dissertation that I wrote when I was 17 as part of my Extended Project Qualification in Upper 6th Form. I was awarded 51/54 A*. (Approx. 7,500 words)

## Abstract
Following the hype surrounding Bitcoin, I aimed to understand what the actual technology behind cryptocurrencies was, and what kind of applications it could have. <br/> <br/>
I first looked at how the need for societies to reliably record and manage data is becoming increasingly difficult as the amount of data grows in the digital era. Consequently, individuals are losing trust in the safety of their personal data. This trust deficit can be breached by Blockchain, a crypto-secured, decentralised and immutable ledger system. I looked into the mysterious origin of the first ever Blockchain in 2008. I explained how it was created to support a cryptocurrency named Bitcoin and how it needs mining to operate. <br/> <br/>
I then explored how Blockchain technology is not just the backbone of cryptocurrencies, but how it can be combined with ‘smart contracts’ to store data and exchange anything of value safely and efficiently. I used energy peer-to-peer trading as a potential example of such transactions. After explaining what smart contracts are, I looked at how they operate on Blockchains such as Ethereum, and how they use Decentralised Applications as interface with their users. <br/> <br/>
In the third part, I used healthcare as one specific industry that could benefit from Blockchain technology. I found out how Blockchain can help with storing, managing and monitoring medical data and therefore could benefit patients, researchers, insurance companies, the pharmaceutical industry and the authorities. I also looked at how Blockchain technology could have life-saving applications, either directly by fighting counterfeit drugs or facilitating transplants, or indirectly by helping authorities with their public health surveillance. <br/> <br/>
I concluded that beyond supporting cryptocurrencies, Blockchain technology has exciting potential uses that could transform many industries, not least of them the healthcare sector, and bring individuals greater freedom and safety over their own personal data. 

## Introduction
Since 2008, a new type of digital currency called cryptocurrency has emerged and become a world-wide phenomenon. The oldest and most famous cryptocurrency is Bitcoin, and it is often criticised in the media for its dangerous associations with the Dark Web<sup>1</sup> , and the irresponsible speculation it attracts. According to “Google Trends”, the word Bitcoin was the second most searched up word in global news for 2017<sup>2</sup>.<br/> <br/>
However, beyond all this hype, the majority of people have a limited knowledge of cryptocurrencies and more importantly, of the technology behind them which is called ‘Blockchain”. This project intends to study the context and origins of Bitcoin and how its creator(s) managed to build a decentralised and immutable ledger called ‘Blockchain’ to support their new peer-to-peer cash system. Blockchain technology uses new terminology such as ‘mining’, ‘hashing’, ‘smart contract’, ‘DApp’ which will be defined, and I will also look into the various types of Blockchains. I aim to explore the exciting potential of Blockchain beyond cryptocurrencies, and I will use the example of one particular sector, the healthcare industry, to see how Blockchain could improve and transform it. <br/> <br/>

## Where did the Blockchain come from, and what is it?
### The Growing Trust Gap
Societies need to record the exchange of good and services in a business context (for instance invoices and credit notes) and to record information relating to individuals or organisations (such as birth, marriage and death records). Recording the journey of a good or service from producer to consumer or recording the journey of an individual from birth to death relies on many different types of intermediaries like lawyers, governmental officials, accountants and financial institutions. These intermediaries are needed to reassure both parties in any specific transaction and create trust. <br/> <br/>
However, as societies grow and global trade expands, recording all transactions becomes increasingly complicated and requires a lot of manpower and storage facilities. It is also subject to system failures and to human errors or frauds. Relying on intermediaries to accurately record and audit data is time consuming and costly, and sometimes the process is not transparent enough. Diamonds are a good example on how difficult it is to document accurately each step of their global journey to ensure each piece is real and ethically mined. Another example of how trust can only stem from secure recording can be found in the voting system: if individual votes are tempered with by not being properly recorded and added, then elections cannot be trusted. <br/> <br/>
We also interact with an increasing number of devices and machines. The connection with these devices, also called the Internet of Things (IoT), is growing exponentially. Thus, it is estimated that by 2025, there will be 80 billion devices connected to the Internet (Kanellos, 2016). These interactions generate a huge amount of data which also need to be recorded securely. <br/> <br/>
Not only is it becoming increasingly difficult to store and manage an ever-increasing amount of data, but our trust in the institutions or companies that handle the data is dwindling. A 2014 British survey for the Royal Statistical Society highlighted how the public did not trust institutions in the media, internet services such as social media and telecommunication companies to use personal data appropriately (Jackson, 2014). And it is true that there have been an increasing amount of scandals about private data being inappropriately used either by government (such as with Edward Snowden’s revelation about governmental surveillance activities (Edward Snowden)) or by companies (such as the Facebook-Cambridge Analytica data scandal where 87 million Facebook users’ personal data was allegedly used by Cambridge Analytica to influence voter opinion (Facebook–Cambridge Analytica data scandal)). <br/> <br/>
Individuals are therefore concerned about data privacy, and they are also worried about the ability of companies to protect their personal data collected on line because of security breaches at major retailers, financial institutions and other companies. The latest fraud at the time of writing this essay concerns the hacking of British Airways’ website and app in Sept 2018, resulting in the theft of data from thousands of customers (British Airways breach: How did hackers get in?, 2018). <br/> <br/>

Trust is paramount in dealing with other individuals and corporations in a business context but also with institutions and governments, and even with machines. This trust is being dangerously stretched. This is called the Trust Gap or Deficit, and we need a new technology to breach it. 

### How Blockchain can help bridge the Trust Gap

This is where Blockchain technology can help because it offers all parties involved in a transaction a secure and synchronised record of all the sequences of this transaction from beginning to end. As Richie Etwaru describes in his TEDx talk about Blockchain (Etwaru, 2017), Blockchain is a **decentralised, immutable ledger system**. Each block on the chain represents hundreds of records and it is stored in chronological order with all the other blocks – thus creating a chain of information. The chain is in essence a giant ledger, just like a bank would keep a centralised record of its clients’ transactions in chronological order. <br/> <br/>
**Decentralised** means that, rather than storing data within one server in one location, all the data is spread across thousands of computers all over the globe (Buterin, 2017). Data is not held or owned by one person or one organisation. Therefore, if someone was to try and corrupt the system or steal data, they could not do so by attacking one node (a computer connected to a network) but would instead have to attack multiple nodes on the system. Given the fact there can be thousands of nodes, this would prove virtually impossible. For example, the Bitcoin Blockchain has 11,426 full nodes across the globe (Global Bitcoin Nodes Distribution, 2017)<sup>34</sup>. This makes the Blockchain safe as it means that it cannot be taken offline, deleted or corrupted, unlike major banks where a power outage or an attack on the main site could take down the whole network. Finally, all transactions made through a public Blockchain can easily be seen on the Blockchain website. All transactions are public which provides complete transparency. For example, when visiting www.Blockchain.info, you can select any block of transactions and see the information about each transaction; the amount of bitcoins transacted, the sender and receiver's addresses and more similar information<sup>5</sup>.<br/> <br/> 
**Immutable** has a definition of 'unchanging over time'. This is fitting description because a Blockchain is a system that cannot be altered without detection. The Blockchain is inalterable since anything put onto the Blockchain remains there forever. When a new block of data is added to the chain, it is spread across the whole network and linked with all other blocks. Attackers would need to take control of 51% of the network to change the data. Furthermore, when a record is added, a key is created using the data for that record. This is a key that is unable to be hacked, rendering that data input inaccessible for change or tampering. Then, when a second record is added, a new key is created, this time using the data from the second input, the data from the first record and the key for the first record. This continues as the third record uses the first and second and so on. In essence, it would be like trying to take out the bottom brick from a wall. To do so, you would have to break down the entire wall. <br/> <br/>
In summary, trust is being challenged by concerns over the security of our personal data, our finance and our transactions. Thanks to Blockchain technology, users can benefit from the openness of the internet as well as the security of cryptography to access and verify information in the most efficient manner. Because of its immutability and decentralisation, **Blockchain is the most secure data storage system to date**. Due to the decentralisation a large network of computers is required to store the data and process all new data coming onto the chain. This is where the term 'mining' comes into play. However, before looking into mining, I need to explain the history of Blockchain: who did create Blockchain and why is it associated with Bitcoins?

<sup>3.</sup> A full node is a node which enforces all the rules of the Blockchain<br/>
<sup>4.</sup> Bitcoin is an online cryptocurrency which was created in 2008. It can be used like normal currency to buy goods and services from many companies such as Subway and Microsoft (Chokun, 2018) <br/>
<sup>5.</sup> See Figure 1, Figure 2 and Figure 3 <br/>

### Satoshi Nakamoto's "White Paper"

The concept of Blockchain was first described in 1991 by Stuart Haber and W. Scott Stornetta (Scott-Briggs, 2018). Haber and Stornetta initially described a secured chain of blocks of data all timestamped to keep track of when data was submitted and last altered.<br/> <br/> 
In 2008, inspired by this concept, one or several computer programmers published a document under the pseudonym of Satoshi Nakamoto. This document, which is now known as “the White Paper”, laid the groundwork for the Bitcoin Protocol: 'a purely peer-to-peer version of electronic cash would allow online payments to be sent directly from one party to another without going through a financial institution' (Nakamoto, 2008). To this date, a big mystery still surrounds Nakamoto's real identity. Although the name sounds Japanese, Nakamoto's use of perfect English has raised scepticism as to his Japanese origin. No one knows who Nakamoto is, but whoever he/she is, they possess roughly 5% of the bitcoin currency which at the height of Bitcoin was worth $19.4 billion (Wong, 2017).<br/> <br/> 
The White Paper set about explaining the problem of trust in all electronic payments. Without a banking authority acting as a trusted, third-party broker, two entities trying to transact with each other have no way of ensuring the trustworthiness of one another. This is commonly known as the Trust Gap. <br/> <br/> 
Historically, the main problem associated with electronic payment systems is double spending. Double spending is a flaw within digital cash schemes in which the same digital coin is spent more than once. This is because each coin is simply a data file that can be duplicated or manipulated (What is Bitcoin Double Spending?, 2017). This issue is tackled by Nakamoto through public announcements of all transactions and the use of timestamping each transaction. The timestamp of the previous block and the data within the current block are used to form a hash that serves as a timestamp, proving that the transaction has happened. This means that if the coin were to be spent again, the network could see which transaction happened first. Nakamoto utilised timestamping to create a framework for Bitcoin so that the coin could be used online with reliability and trust and could be distributed across the globe without the need for intermediaries.<br/> <br/> 
So what is a hash? A hash is a unique 64 digit hexadecimal number obtained by entering data through a hashing algorithm (Hash Function) (Surrall & Hamflett, 2017). It is able to shrink any size of data into a manageable and storable format. This means even the largest of transaction records can be condensed and stored (Hendricks, 2017).<br/> <br/> 
Besides shrinking the information (hashing), the transaction needs to be authenticated by the recipient, thus avoiding the need to rely on third parties, such as banks, to validate transactions. The hashed version of the transaction is called the public key, accessible by everyone. The private key is used to mathematically decrypt the public key. This private key is only known to one person, therefore, when the transaction is encrypted with the public key, it is sent to everyone on the network safely knowing that no one else could decrypt it. However, only the one who holds the relevant key is able to decrypt this and gain access to the bitcoins that have been sent (Roose, 2016). This is like sending a locked suitcase on a public train. Everyone can see the suitcase but only its recipient has the key to open it<sup>6</sup>.<br/> <br/> 
<sup>6.</sup> This is where the term cryptocurrency comes from as cryptography is used to secure the transactions <br/>

### How Mining Fuels the Bitcoin Blockchain

Hundreds to thousands of pending transactions form a block: 'every ten minutes, like the heartbeat of the network, all the transactions conducted are verified, cleared, and stored in a block which is linked to the preceding block, thereby creating a chain' (Tapscott & Tapscott, Blockchain Revolution, 2016). This auditing work obviously requires a lot of computing power from across the network, which needs rewarding. Just like miners get rewarded with gold, people who provide this computing power are rewarded with Bitcoins – this is where the term 'Bitcoin Mining' comes from. <br/> <br/> 
A hash is produced from all the data within the block along with the hash of the previous block. For a block to be verified a miner must find an input that will create a hash number that is either equal to or smaller than the hash of the block. They do this through trial and error by entering slight variations to find the needed input. The first miner to find this correct input announces his/her result to the nodes on the network. All the other miners then check if they agree with his/her result. Once more than 51% of all nodes agree, the block gets added to the ledger and the entire network moves onto the next block (How bitcoin mining works, 2015). The fact that the data is passed through a hash algorithm allows miners to interact with it and use it in the proof-of-work and verify the data without being able to actually read it (due to the one way nature of hashing), thus allowing privacy within transactions.<br/> <br/> 
The reward for solving a block is 12.5 BTC<sup>7</sup>. At the current market price of £5,000<sup>8</sup>, this pays the miner £62,500, a very strong incentive to keep mining. This might seem like a lot of money; however, the revenue generated through mining incurs large outlay of money such as the initial investment in computer hardware and running costs like electricity and personal overheads. When Bitcoin was first released the verifications were simpler and so most individuals could run mining rigs with a home computer. However, as the chain increases, the complexity increases and requires powerful, dedicated servers running 24/7 rather than ordinary home computers. Moreover, every 210,000 blocks mined (4 years) the reward for mining one block is halved meaning miners lose 50% of their revenue in an instant (Donnelly, 2016). Why does it halve? Just like real gold, bitcoins are a limited resource. There will only ever be 21 million bitcoins available. Satoshi Nakamoto's program only allowed a block to be added every 10 minutes. So 6 blocks an hour, 24 hours a day, 365 days a year for a 4 year cycle equal 210,000 blocks being mined before the reward halves and the mining difficulty increases. When halving the reward to infinity, the sum of all block reward sizes adds to 100 bitcoins. Therefore, the maths goes: 50x210,000 + 25x210,000 + 12.5x210,000 and so on, adding up to 21 million bitcoins total needed to reward the miners. Economically, because the currency is infinitely divisible, the precise amount available does not matter, as long as the limit remains fixed. In truth nobody truly knows why Nakamoto set the cycle at 4 years and the original value of a block at 50 bitcoins. However, as miners gained bitcoin they gained an incentive to ensure its survival so that their hard work wouldn't go to waste. Moreover, as the reward minimised, people worked harder to gain it drawing in more competition and more miners to keep the Blockchain alive.<br/> <br/> 
Nakamoto wanted to base his new currency on that of gold or silver rather than the standard fiat currencies<sup>9</sup>. Fiat currencies can be reprinted and cause the value of the notes to fluctuate and cause inflation. When Nakamoto released his Bitcoin the world was in a recession caused by the corruption and irregularities in banking and so Nakamoto wanted to create a coin that could not be manipulated and would allow the value of bitcoin to constantly rise as the supply diminishes.<br/> <br/> 

<sup>7.</sup> BTC is the shorthand way of writing Bitcoin </br>
<sup>8.</sup> As of 09/09/2018 </br>
<sup>9.</sup> A fiat currency is a currency without intrinsic value, established as a payment system. </br>

### Limitations of the Bitcoin Blochchain
As explained above, Satoshi Nakamoto’s network takes 10 minutes to create a block and it is estimated that it can only manage seven transactions per second (TPS). Each individual transaction can take anywhere from 10 minutes to many days to be confirmed. Indeed, the timings depend on the amount of hash power available on the network at the point of transacting. This volatility in transaction time makes it difficult to imagine a day when a consumer could use Bitcoin to pay quickly for a take-away coffee for instance, limiting the use of Bitcoin as a cryptocurrency. (Blockchain speeds & the scalability debate, 2018) <br/> <br/> 
![Average Confirmation Time](/images/limitations-of-blockchain.png) <br/> <br/>
Another major problem with Bitcoin blockchain is its environmental impact. Due to the mathematical algorithm used to validate transactions in the Bitcoin blockchain (called Proof of Work), the Bitcoin mining process uses a huge computational power. According to Digiconomist, worldwide Bitcoin mining requires more energy that the whole of the Czech Republic needs (Bitcoin Energy Consumption Index). This negative environmental impact has been well documented in the press, with some journalists going as far as describing Bitcoin Mining as an “climate threat” (Hern, 2018).<br/> <br/> 
Ultimately, Bitcoin as a cryptocurrency might not last because mining for it will become too expensive and/or the computing power will become insufficient to back-up transactions, slowing the whole network down to a stop. The financial speculation around the price of a Bitcoin also has a negative impact: how can goods and services be valued in bitcoins if the actual Bitcoin value varies so much? Thus, Bitcoins were valued at nearly $20,000 in December 2017 but fell to $6,000 in September 2018 (Bitcoin (USD) Price). If Bitcoins become useless as a digital currency, will the technology behind them also lapse? 

### Conclusion
Satoshi Nakamoto’s original aim was to simplify online transactions by bypassing governments’ control of currencies. However, in writing the protocol for Bitcoin, he/she laid the ground work for other types of blockchains. Bitcoins might turn out to be another “bubble” which will burst in due time, but the technology behind it will survive<sup>10</sup>. Indeed, Blockchain is not just about cryptocurrencies or monetary transactions. Blockchain is the operating system, and Bitcoin is only one of the many applications that can be run on that system. Bitcoin can be compared to the Ford Model T car produced in the 1900s, and Blockchain to its engine (Elnaj, 2018). Blockchain technology is here to stay: it will evolve and power many more marvellous inventions. <br/> <br/> 

<sup>10.</sup> A bubble is created when an asset is traded at a price that is far larger than its intrinsic value. A bubble is said to crash when the asset price drops drastically and suddenly</br>


## Blockchain Beyond Cryptocurrencies
The Bitcoin Blockchain is designed specifically to transact cryptocurrencies, it is open and public and also anonymous, keeping the identity of who is involved in the transaction secret. Because of this, is requires complex cryptography to prevent frauds and therefore major computing power. However, a business Blockchain can be designed to remain private and can grant access to specific data only to relevant parties. In this chapter, I will try and explain how this type of Blockchains can enable individuals or entities to exchange anything of value with the use of **'smart contracts'**. 
### Smart Contracts
As seen previously, the core benefit of Blockchains is to overcome the limitations of synchronising databases since individuals and companies can store data with complete reliability in a decentralised manner. This main function can be even further boosted by incorporating systems that allow decentralised transactions between two or more users under pre-agreed, specific conditions. These are called “smart contracts” (Çiftçi, 2018).<br/> <br/> 
The concept of **“smart contract”** started in 1994 when Nick Szabo, a computer scientist and cryptographer, wrote an article about smart contract (Szabo, 1994). <br/> <br/> 
What is a smart contract? It is “similar to a contract in the physical world, but it is digital and is represented by a tiny computer program stored inside a Blockchain” (H.). It is a piece of computer code which can monitor, execute and enforce an agreement without third party intervention: once the smart contract is put into operation, it is carried out by a network system without any human input following its initiation by the parties. The fact that no-one can intervene or tamper with the execution of the contract is why it is called “smart”. Thus, a direct debit with online banking is not a smart contract since it can be terminated or amended at any time. Smart contracts bring three advantages compared to normal contracts: certainty (computer codes are clear whereas ambiguous legal language can lead to different interpretations), speed (they are implemented almost instantly without human involvement) and cost-efficiency (after the initial cost of programming, running costs are low since there is no human involvement). Blockchain is the perfect technology to support smart contracts since it is secured through the use of cryptographic keys, it is immutable, and it is decentralised. Smart contracts could be used in a multitude of industries. One example is the energy sector where Blockchain-based smart contracts could help create “prosumers”: individual consumers who are also producing energy such as homes with solar panels. This peer-to-peer energy trading could be made possible by smart contracts triggering transactions automatically by allowing prosumers to feed surplus energy into the grid thanks to a Blockchain-enabled meter. This flow of electricity could be coded into the Blockchain with buyers and sellers being matched by algorithms in real time based on their preferences. Then payment would be trigged automatically thanks to the smart contract upon delivery of electricity without the need for a central control. This is already happening with the Brooklyn Microgrid which is a promising experiment where 50 participants (residents and businesses of this New York neighbourhood) are trading excess electricity produced by their solar panels (Cardwell, 2017). The project is still in its early stages but offers a lot of hope.

### Ethereum
There are many platforms available for smart contracts. Ethereum is one of the most prominent smart contract frameworks. It was launched in 2014 by Vitalik Buterin, a 19-year-old Canadian computer programmer, and it went live in July 2015. Ethereum is a decentralised system which is not controlled by anyone since it is run from thousands of volunteers’ computers around the world. Ethereum used the technology behind Bitcoin and expanded its capabilities. In the Ethereum Blockchain, miners do not mine for Bitcoins but they work to earn Ether, a type of crypto token that fuels the network. Unlike bitcoin which is primarily a cryptocurrency, Ethereum enables the use of smart contracts on a Blockchain technology through the Ether tokens. There is a second type of token that is used to pay miners fees for including transactions in their block, and it is called gas. Each smart contract execution requires a certain amount of gas to be sent along with it to entice miners to put the smart contract onto the Blockchain (What is Ethereum. Guide for Beginners).<br/> <br/> 
So both Ethereum and Bitcoin are Blockchains with their own currencies, but the Ethereum network also works as a global computer thanks to smart contracts, and its tokens Ether is not limited to being used as a currency but can be also used to support any kind of computer applications. Bitcoin is more specific than Ethereum since it focuses on electronic cash transaction between two parties whereas Ethereum Blockchain focuses on running the programming code for any **decentralised application (“DApp”)**. 

### Decentralised Applications
What is the difference between a traditional App and a DApp? A traditional App, like Facebook, gathers a huge amount of private information about its users (name, date of birth, location, photos, relationship, etc.) and centralises this enormous database on their private servers. These centralised servers are expensive to maintain, but more importantly they can be shut down or hacked, and users’ personal information can be retrieved fraudulently or even be sold to marketing companies.<br/> <br/> 
A DApp is a decentralised application which unlike today’s Apps like Gmail or Uber does not require a middleman because it connects users and providers directly. This new generation of apps opens a whole new use of Blockchain technology and are not really distinguishable to the end-user from traditional apps. A DApp can be a web page, a desktop or look like a mobile app: the difference is that its data is not hosted on local or cloud servers but on a Blockchain, a network of nodes that keep an identical ledger. Since no organisation is liable for securing their users’ data in a centralised location, there are no staff cost to pay, no servers to maintain, no overheads. There is no temptation to sell user data in order to cover these costs. Because of the data is kept on a Blockchain, it is very secure. (King, 2018)<br/> <br/> 
One of the earliest DApp project is Golem. Golem is an Ethereum based program which decentralises computing power. When using a computer, not all of its capabilities are used. Golem allows a user to share the unused computing power of their computer with those who need it. The 'renter' pays the user in Golem tokens that are tradeable and sellable. The Golem project took three years to become live in April 2018 as it faced complicated technical barriers, but it is generating a lot of interest and managed to raise $340 million (O'Leary, 2018). DApps are still in their early days but as data security and privacy become increasingly important, users are more and more likely to turn towards decentralised services. <br/> <br/> 
In summary, smart contracts are self-executing contracts where the terms of agreement are directly written into lines of code and which operate across a Blockchain network. Smart contracts help all participants to exchange capital, property or anything else of value in a safe method without the need for any central entity or for thirds parties. A DApp is the useful interface which allows the end user to access efficiently and safely these Blockchain-based smart contracts. They are very similar to a traditional App for the end-user but instead of using an API<sup>11</sup> to connect to a centralised database, it uses smart contracts to execute commands and retrieve information from an immutable and decentralised Blockchain like Ethereum. There are currently 1,901 DApps up and running, mainly in games, gambling, trading and finance, but many more projects are currently being tested (State of the DApps). The Blockchain community believes that decentralised applications will improve, transform and even disrupt many industries. In the next chapter I will focus on one specific sector which could gain from Blockchain technology: healthcare.<br/> <br/> 
<sup>11.</sup> API is a set of procedures that allow the creation of applications through the access of features or data of an operating system

## Blockchain in Healthcare
The healthcare industry interconnects multiple parties: patients, care providers (such as doctors and hospitals), payers (the patients themselves, their employers, the State or insurance companies) and sellers (pharmaceutical companies for instance). This complex interaction means overwhelming data and associated paperwork: prescriptions, medical history, laboratory tests, complex billing systems, medical research results and more. In this chapter, I will look at how Blockchain can help the healthcare industry. <br/> <br/>
Medical records are essential in caring for a patient but are often spread across several locations and systems and therefore can be fragmented, lost or even corrupted. Thus, I lived in Uzbekistan when I was a child and all my medical information was handwritten in Russian, then I moved to Indonesia and finally to the UK so my health history is very incomplete. Also, medical records might not be easily accessible to the patients. In my case, our Indonesian clinic’s protocol prevented my parents to have full and direct access to my whole medical file: a formal letter had to be written in order to request access to specific documents only. Finally, there are environments such as war zones where it is virtually impossible to maintain consistent medical records because the humanitarian workforce treating the refugees come and go. All this data storage and management could be improved thanks to the use of the immutable, decentralised ledger system that is a Blockchain. After putting all the various medical information on a Blockchain, patients could get their own private key to access their personal data. Patients would not have to worry about personal data safety and should they grant access to third parties, they would be safe in the knowledge that their identity remains anonymous. Moreover, they could also see how and by whom their personal health information is being used. One prototype MedRec is being developed by MIT: it is currently integrating Blockchain technology into electronic health records (EHRs) to allow records to be accessed efficiently (Marr, 2017)<sup>12</sup> . This saves time, money and procedure duplication as all the records are stored in one virtual location rather than spread across incompatible EHR systems. Eleonore Pauwels and Nathaniel Grevatt describe how all records are available through a Blockchain, but every patient's record requires a unique authentication (Grevatt, 2017). This allows patients to still have access to their files but also let relevant parties gain access to sections of the data. This could increase the security in data management. Between 2015 and 2016, 140 million patient records were breached (Protenus & DataBreaches.net, 2016). The introduction of a Blockchain would give security to patients to know that their data could never be corrupted, stolen or sold without their permission. Another exciting project is how the start-up Iryo deployed blockchain-based electronic health records in refugee camps in Jordan, enabling patients to store their own health data on their mobile phones. (Green, 2018) <br/> <br/> 
Patients need to have easy and reliable access to their own medical files, but researchers would also benefit from accessing large-scale medical data without invading people’s privacy. Even if patients grant access to their data for research use, it can be hard to manage large volumes of information securely and with the proper authorisation rights. Thus, MedRec allows users to grant research facilities access to their data anonymously. This allows researchers access to large data sets that could help make medical breakthroughs faster than they have ever been. Another project called BreastWeCan.com also encourages women to share the results of their mammograms with medical researchers with the use of Blockchain. Researchers plan to train their Artificial Intelligence algorithm on millions of mammograms in order to classify tumours with more accuracy, so they need women to volunteer in the knowledge that their files are secure thanks to Blockchain technology: these women will be able to give or revoke access to their data using an online portal which relies on Blockchain. (Maxmen, 2018)<br/> <br/> 
Beside the storage and management of patients’ data, Blockchain could also help the medical industry store research files (Marr, 2017). Currently new procedures are being found and old ones updated. However, these are stored in separate, disconnected systems making it hard for a doctor to search all directories to find treatments and procedures. Having all these breakthroughs stored on one public Blockchain would allow doctors across the globe to have access to one reliable source of information containing all the newest revelations in the medical field. Smart contracts can then be introduced to this type of Blockchain. If certain steps of the research required data from its predecessor, then a smart contract could be utilised to ensure the transfer of data through each step (Benchoufi & Ravaud, 2017). This would be automated and stored securely to safeguard the data and increase the efficiency of the research section.<br/> <br/> 
As I explained above, managing safely and anonymously patients’ medical data and research data is a key challenge for the health industry, but another challenge is the traceability of drugs to avoid counterfeit. Counterfeit medicines are a growing threat to public health around the world and earn criminals billions of dollars in revenue. Thus, the World Health Organisation estimates that tens of thousands of children die as a result of $30bn spent on counterfeit drugs and that 1 in 10 drugs circulating in developing countries are harmful counterfeits (10% of drugs in poor countries are fake, says WHO, 2017). Introducing a Blockchain into the manufacture of drugs would allow users to trace the origins of their drugs and authenticate their reliability. Every step of the production would be added to the Blockchain allowing users to track where their batch came from (Bhardwaj, 2018). <br/> <br/> 
Not only would Blockchain-based tracking systems help patients and care providers trace their drugs, but it could also reduce overheads for the pharmaceutical companies. It could help them with their inventory management to prepare for spikes in demand. It could also help save money by removing the need for third-party logistics companies who provide information on the movement of pharmaceutical products. (Bhardwaj, Five use cases for blockchain in pharma, 2018)<br/> <br/> 
Blockchain smart contracts could also be used for life-saving transplants, for instance kidneys transplants. Currently multiple transplant lists exist across the world: waiting lists for patients in need of a new kidney along with lists of potential donors. Using smart contracts, people looking for kidneys and potential kidney donors could be matched not just on a one-for-one basis but in a whole chain of transplants: a wife who is not a match for her husband could give a kidney to a third person whose sibling is compatible with her husband thus creating a chain of interrelated transplants called a “Kidney Paired Donation”. Thus, the Kidner Project wants to make a Blockchain-based list of people waiting for kidney transplant which would be cryptographically secure and transparent. Its decentralised platform aims at helping hospitals do kidney paired-exchange on a world-wide scale. (Kidner Project)<br/> <br/> 
On a financial level, Blockchain smart contracts could also be used to improve billing management. Frauds in the healthcare industry can take many forms: patients may fake invoices to get reimbursed by their medical insurance and providers may create fake patients or invoice non-performed services. Such frauds put a huge financial strain on healthcare around the world. In the UK alone, frauds committed by patients, staff and contractors cost the NHS £1.25bn or 1% of the total NHS budget. For instance, dentists were said to be claiming around £70m on NHS patients for work not carried out. Trying to detect and fight fraud is in itself expensive too as it means more field officers to gather evidence (Triggle, 2017). Blockchain could assist authorities and healthcare providers in eliminating fraud by providing them with an auditable and unalterable chain of medical transactions. For instance, Healthureum describes itself as a new ecosystem of healthcare services based on Ethereum Blockchain. Its platform aims to reduce fraud by using smart contracts which will facilitate payment for services using tokens, thus enabling payment directly peer to peer so there are no third-party fees and delays. It also hopes to conduct background checks on all doctors who intend to be on their network to ensure only qualified and honest doctors provide medical services. (Healthureum)<br/> <br/> 
Finally, Blockchain technology can help with global and national public health surveillance through the gathering and sharing of medical data: authorities need to monitor population health, identify risks and trends in disease spread, and anticipate future expense on chronic diseases. These surveillance programs are key in societies increasingly dependent on movement of people and trade of products. Hashed Health is an American start-up company which is working on prototypes exploring the role of Blockchain and distributed ledger systems in supporting public health and disease surveillance programs. Another example is how the US Centre for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) is exploring Blockchain technology use to store and share medical records faster: for instance, it could track on-going issues like opioid abuse or manage data during a crisis like a pandemic, while complying with security and privacy laws. (Orcutt, 2017)<br/> <br/> 
In conclusion, Blockchain technology is already helping and will soon revolutionised the way the health industry works. It can help with storing, managing and monitoring medical data, it can improve the pharmaceutical supply chain to prevent counterfeit drugs as well as insurance claim management to prevent frauds. It can also have direct life-saving applications (kidney transplants) and also a more general, long-term impact thanks to improved medical research and public health surveillance. The time, energy and money saved thanks to Blockchain technology will be redirected towards improving health and treating disease rather than being wasted.

## Conclusion
The recent hype and controversies around cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin are what first attracted me to the subject of Blockchain. This brand-new technology has generated weird and wonderful buzz words such as “mining”, “Smart Contract”, “DApp” and I originally set out to understand what these new concepts meant and how they worked from a purely a technical point of view. However, I was soon overwhelmed by all the possible applications of Blockchain in so many industries beyond the financial sector. The Blockchain community has great hopes, and maybe some of their projects are unrealistic, but I am genuinely excited by this efficient, anonymous and secure way of storing data and assets without the need for a central authority or third parties. Blockchain will not just bring financial benefits to some big industries but also greater freedom for each individual to access, use and even market their own personal data in a fast and safe manner, especially in the healthcare sector. Blockchain could even play a life-saving role, from helping with transplants to fighting the war against fake drugs and monitoring the spread of epidemics in real time.

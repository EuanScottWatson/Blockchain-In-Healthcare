# What are the potential benefits of Blockchain in Healthcare?
This is a dissertation I wrote when I was 17 as part of my Extended Project Qualification in Upper 6th Form.

## Abstract
Following the hype surrounding Bitcoin, I aimed to understand what the actual technology behind cryptocurrencies was, and what kind of applications it could have. <br/> <br/>
I first looked at how the need for societies to reliably record and manage data is becoming increasingly difficult as the amount of data grows in the digital era. Consequently, individuals are losing trust in the safety of their personal data. This trust deficit can be breached by Blockchain, a crypto-secured, decentralised and immutable ledger system. I looked into the mysterious origin of the first ever Blockchain in 2008. I explained how it was created to support a cryptocurrency named Bitcoin and how it needs mining to operate. <br/> <br/>
I then explored how Blockchain technology is not just the backbone of cryptocurrencies, but how it can be combined with ‘smart contracts’ to store data and exchange anything of value safely and efficiently. I used energy peer-to-peer trading as a potential example of such transactions. After explaining what smart contracts are, I looked at how they operate on Blockchains such as Ethereum, and how they use Decentralised Applications as interface with their users. <br/> <br/>
In the third part, I used healthcare as one specific industry that could benefit from Blockchain technology. I found out how Blockchain can help with storing, managing and monitoring medical data and therefore could benefit patients, researchers, insurance companies, the pharmaceutical industry and the authorities. I also looked at how Blockchain technology could have life-saving applications, either directly by fighting counterfeit drugs or facilitating transplants, or indirectly by helping authorities with their public health surveillance. <br/> <br/>
I concluded that beyond supporting cryptocurrencies, Blockchain technology has exciting potential uses that could transform many industries, not least of them the healthcare sector, and bring individuals greater freedom and safety over their own personal data. <br/> <br/>

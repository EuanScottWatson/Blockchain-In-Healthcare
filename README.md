# What are the potential benefits of Blockchain in Healthcare?
This is a dissertation I wrote when I was 17 as part of my Extended Project Qualification in Upper 6th Form.

## Contents
## Abstract
Following the hype surrounding Bitcoin, I aimed to understand what the actual technology behind cryptocurrencies was, and what kind of applications it could have. <br/> <br/>
I first looked at how the need for societies to reliably record and manage data is becoming increasingly difficult as the amount of data grows in the digital era. Consequently, individuals are losing trust in the safety of their personal data. This trust deficit can be breached by Blockchain, a crypto-secured, decentralised and immutable ledger system. I looked into the mysterious origin of the first ever Blockchain in 2008. I explained how it was created to support a cryptocurrency named Bitcoin and how it needs mining to operate. <br/> <br/>
I then explored how Blockchain technology is not just the backbone of cryptocurrencies, but how it can be combined with ‘smart contracts’ to store data and exchange anything of value safely and efficiently. I used energy peer-to-peer trading as a potential example of such transactions. After explaining what smart contracts are, I looked at how they operate on Blockchains such as Ethereum, and how they use Decentralised Applications as interface with their users. <br/> <br/>
In the third part, I used healthcare as one specific industry that could benefit from Blockchain technology. I found out how Blockchain can help with storing, managing and monitoring medical data and therefore could benefit patients, researchers, insurance companies, the pharmaceutical industry and the authorities. I also looked at how Blockchain technology could have life-saving applications, either directly by fighting counterfeit drugs or facilitating transplants, or indirectly by helping authorities with their public health surveillance. <br/> <br/>
I concluded that beyond supporting cryptocurrencies, Blockchain technology has exciting potential uses that could transform many industries, not least of them the healthcare sector, and bring individuals greater freedom and safety over their own personal data. <br/> <br/>

## Introduction
Since 2008, a new type of digital currency called cryptocurrency has emerged and become a world-wide phenomenon. The oldest and most famous cryptocurrency is Bitcoin, and it is often criticised in the media for its dangerous associations with the Dark Web<sup>1</sup> , and the irresponsible speculation it attracts. According to “Google Trends”, the word Bitcoin was the second most searched up word in global news for 2017<sup>2</sup>.<br/> <br/>
However, beyond all this hype, the majority of people have a limited knowledge of cryptocurrencies and more importantly, of the technology behind them which is called ‘Blockchain”. This project intends to study the context and origins of Bitcoin and how its creator(s) managed to build a decentralised and immutable ledger called ‘Blockchain’ to support their new peer-to-peer cash system. Blockchain technology uses new terminology such as ‘mining’, ‘hashing’, ‘smart contract’, ‘DApp’ which will be defined, and I will also look into the various types of Blockchains. I aim to explore the exciting potential of Blockchain beyond cryptocurrencies, and I will use the example of one particular sector, the healthcare industry, to see how Blockchain could improve and transform it. <br/> <br/>

## Where did the Blockchain come from, and what is it?
### The Growing Trust Gap
Societies need to record the exchange of good and services in a business context (for instance invoices and credit notes) and to record information relating to individuals or organisations (such as birth, marriage and death records). Recording the journey of a good or service from producer to consumer or recording the journey of an individual from birth to death relies on many different types of intermediaries like lawyers, governmental officials, accountants and financial institutions. These intermediaries are needed to reassure both parties in any specific transaction and create trust. <br/> <br/>
However, as societies grow and global trade expands, recording all transactions becomes increasingly complicated and requires a lot of manpower and storage facilities. It is also subject to system failures and to human errors or frauds. Relying on intermediaries to accurately record and audit data is time consuming and costly, and sometimes the process is not transparent enough. Diamonds are a good example on how difficult it is to document accurately each step of their global journey to ensure each piece is real and ethically mined. Another example of how trust can only stem from secure recording can be found in the voting system: if individual votes are tempered with by not being properly recorded and added, then elections cannot be trusted. <br/> <br/>
We also interact with an increasing number of devices and machines. The connection with these devices, also called the Internet of Things (IoT), is growing exponentially. Thus, it is estimated that by 2025, there will be 80 billion devices connected to the Internet (Kanellos, 2016). These interactions generate a huge amount of data which also need to be recorded securely. <br/> <br/>
Not only is it becoming increasingly difficult to store and manage an ever-increasing amount of data, but our trust in the institutions or companies that handle the data is dwindling. A 2014 British survey for the Royal Statistical Society highlighted how the public did not trust institutions in the media, internet services such as social media and telecommunication companies to use personal data appropriately (Jackson, 2014). And it is true that there have been an increasing amount of scandals about private data being inappropriately used either by government (such as with Edward Snowden’s revelation about governmental surveillance activities (Edward Snowden)) or by companies (such as the Facebook-Cambridge Analytica data scandal where 87 million Facebook users’ personal data was allegedly used by Cambridge Analytica to influence voter opinion (Facebook–Cambridge Analytica data scandal)). <br/> <br/>
Individuals are therefore concerned about data privacy, and they are also worried about the ability of companies to protect their personal data collected on line because of security breaches at major retailers, financial institutions and other companies. The latest fraud at the time of writing this essay concerns the hacking of British Airways’ website and app in Sept 2018, resulting in the theft of data from thousands of customers (British Airways breach: How did hackers get in?, 2018). <br/> <br/>

Trust is paramount in dealing with other individuals and corporations in a business context but also with institutions and governments, and even with machines. This trust is being dangerously stretched. This is called the Trust Gap or Deficit, and we need a new technology to breach it. <br/> <br/>

### How Blockchain can help bridge the Trust Gap

This is where Blockchain technology can help because it offers all parties involved in a transaction a secure and synchronised record of all the sequences of this transaction from beginning to end. As Richie Etwaru describes in his TEDx talk about Blockchain (Etwaru, 2017), Blockchain is a **decentralised, immutable ledger system**. Each block on the chain represents hundreds of records and it is stored in chronological order with all the other blocks – thus creating a chain of information. The chain is in essence a giant ledger, just like a bank would keep a centralised record of its clients’ transactions in chronological order. <br/> <br/>
**Decentralised** means that, rather than storing data within one server in one location, all the data is spread across thousands of computers all over the globe (Buterin, 2017). Data is not held or owned by one person or one organisation. Therefore, if someone was to try and corrupt the system or steal data, they could not do so by attacking one node (a computer connected to a network) but would instead have to attack multiple nodes on the system. Given the fact there can be thousands of nodes, this would prove virtually impossible. For example, the Bitcoin Blockchain has 11,426 full nodes across the globe (Global Bitcoin Nodes Distribution, 2017)<sup>34</sup>. This makes the Blockchain safe as it means that it cannot be taken offline, deleted or corrupted, unlike major banks where a power outage or an attack on the main site could take down the whole network. Finally, all transactions made through a public Blockchain can easily be seen on the Blockchain website. All transactions are public which provides complete transparency. For example, when visiting www.Blockchain.info, you can select any block of transactions and see the information about each transaction; the amount of bitcoins transacted, the sender and receiver's addresses and more similar information<sup>5</sup>.<br/> <br/> 
**Immutable** has a definition of 'unchanging over time'. This is fitting description because a Blockchain is a system that cannot be altered without detection. The Blockchain is inalterable since anything put onto the Blockchain remains there forever. When a new block of data is added to the chain, it is spread across the whole network and linked with all other blocks. Attackers would need to take control of 51% of the network to change the data. Furthermore, when a record is added, a key is created using the data for that record. This is a key that is unable to be hacked, rendering that data input inaccessible for change or tampering. Then, when a second record is added, a new key is created, this time using the data from the second input, the data from the first record and the key for the first record. This continues as the third record uses the first and second and so on. In essence, it would be like trying to take out the bottom brick from a wall. To do so, you would have to break down the entire wall. <br/> <br/>
In summary, trust is being challenged by concerns over the security of our personal data, our finance and our transactions. Thanks to Blockchain technology, users can benefit from the openness of the internet as well as the security of cryptography to access and verify information in the most efficient manner. Because of its immutability and decentralisation, **Blockchain is the most secure data storage system to date**. Due to the decentralisation a large network of computers is required to store the data and process all new data coming onto the chain. This is where the term 'mining' comes into play. However, before looking into mining, I need to explain the history of Blockchain: who did create Blockchain and why is it associated with Bitcoins?

<sup>3.</sup> A full node is a node which enforces all the rules of the Blockchain<br/>

### Satoshi Nakamoto's "White Paper"

The concept of Blockchain was first described in 1991 by Stuart Haber and W. Scott Stornetta (Scott-Briggs, 2018). Haber and Stornetta initially described a secured chain of blocks of data all timestamped to keep track of when data was submitted and last altered.<br/> <br/> 
In 2008, inspired by this concept, one or several computer programmers published a document under the pseudonym of Satoshi Nakamoto. This document, which is now known as “the White Paper”, laid the groundwork for the Bitcoin Protocol: 'a purely peer-to-peer version of electronic cash would allow online payments to be sent directly from one party to another without going through a financial institution' (Nakamoto, 2008). To this date, a big mystery still surrounds Nakamoto's real identity. Although the name sounds Japanese, Nakamoto's use of perfect English has raised scepticism as to his Japanese origin. No one knows who Nakamoto is, but whoever he/she is, they possess roughly 5% of the bitcoin currency which at the height of Bitcoin was worth $19.4 billion (Wong, 2017).<br/> <br/> 
The White Paper set about explaining the problem of trust in all electronic payments. Without a banking authority acting as a trusted, third-party broker, two entities trying to transact with each other have no way of ensuring the trustworthiness of one another. This is commonly known as the Trust Gap. <br/> <br/> 
Historically, the main problem associated with electronic payment systems is double spending. Double spending is a flaw within digital cash schemes in which the same digital coin is spent more than once. This is because each coin is simply a data file that can be duplicated or manipulated (What is Bitcoin Double Spending?, 2017). This issue is tackled by Nakamoto through public announcements of all transactions and the use of timestamping each transaction. The timestamp of the previous block and the data within the current block are used to form a hash that serves as a timestamp, proving that the transaction has happened. This means that if the coin were to be spent again, the network could see which transaction happened first. Nakamoto utilised timestamping to create a framework for Bitcoin so that the coin could be used online with reliability and trust and could be distributed across the globe without the need for intermediaries.<br/> <br/> 
So what is a hash? A hash is a unique 64 digit hexadecimal number obtained by entering data through a hashing algorithm (Hash Function) (Surrall & Hamflett, 2017). It is able to shrink any size of data into a manageable and storable format. This means even the largest of transaction records can be condensed and stored (Hendricks, 2017).<br/> <br/> 
Besides shrinking the information (hashing), the transaction needs to be authenticated by the recipient, thus avoiding the need to rely on third parties, such as banks, to validate transactions. The hashed version of the transaction is called the public key, accessible by everyone. The private key is used to mathematically decrypt the public key. This private key is only known to one person, therefore, when the transaction is encrypted with the public key, it is sent to everyone on the network safely knowing that no one else could decrypt it. However, only the one who holds the relevant key is able to decrypt this and gain access to the bitcoins that have been sent (Roose, 2016). This is like sending a locked suitcase on a public train. Everyone can see the suitcase but only its recipient has the key to open it<sup>6</sup>.<br/> <br/> 
<sup>6.</sup> This is where the term cryptocurrency comes from as cryptography is used to secure the transactions <br/>

### How Mining Fuels the Bitcoin Blockchain

Hundreds to thousands of pending transactions form a block: 'every ten minutes, like the heartbeat of the network, all the transactions conducted are verified, cleared, and stored in a block which is linked to the preceding block, thereby creating a chain' (Tapscott & Tapscott, Blockchain Revolution, 2016). This auditing work obviously requires a lot of computing power from across the network, which needs rewarding. Just like miners get rewarded with gold, people who provide this computing power are rewarded with Bitcoins – this is where the term 'Bitcoin Mining' comes from. <br/> <br/> 
A hash is produced from all the data within the block along with the hash of the previous block. For a block to be verified a miner must find an input that will create a hash number that is either equal to or smaller than the hash of the block. They do this through trial and error by entering slight variations to find the needed input. The first miner to find this correct input announces his/her result to the nodes on the network. All the other miners then check if they agree with his/her result. Once more than 51% of all nodes agree, the block gets added to the ledger and the entire network moves onto the next block (How bitcoin mining works, 2015). The fact that the data is passed through a hash algorithm allows miners to interact with it and use it in the proof-of-work and verify the data without being able to actually read it (due to the one way nature of hashing), thus allowing privacy within transactions.<br/> <br/> 
The reward for solving a block is 12.5 BTC<sup>7</sup>. At the current market price of £5,000<sup>8</sup>, this pays the miner £62,500, a very strong incentive to keep mining. This might seem like a lot of money; however, the revenue generated through mining incurs large outlay of money such as the initial investment in computer hardware and running costs like electricity and personal overheads. When Bitcoin was first released the verifications were simpler and so most individuals could run mining rigs with a home computer. However, as the chain increases, the complexity increases and requires powerful, dedicated servers running 24/7 rather than ordinary home computers. Moreover, every 210,000 blocks mined (4 years) the reward for mining one block is halved meaning miners lose 50% of their revenue in an instant (Donnelly, 2016). Why does it halve? Just like real gold, bitcoins are a limited resource. There will only ever be 21 million bitcoins available. Satoshi Nakamoto's program only allowed a block to be added every 10 minutes. So 6 blocks an hour, 24 hours a day, 365 days a year for a 4 year cycle equal 210,000 blocks being mined before the reward halves and the mining difficulty increases. When halving the reward to infinity, the sum of all block reward sizes adds to 100 bitcoins. Therefore, the maths goes: 50x210,000 + 25x210,000 + 12.5x210,000 and so on, adding up to 21 million bitcoins total needed to reward the miners. Economically, because the currency is infinitely divisible, the precise amount available does not matter, as long as the limit remains fixed. In truth nobody truly knows why Nakamoto set the cycle at 4 years and the original value of a block at 50 bitcoins. However, as miners gained bitcoin they gained an incentive to ensure its survival so that their hard work wouldn't go to waste. Moreover, as the reward minimised, people worked harder to gain it drawing in more competition and more miners to keep the Blockchain alive.<br/> <br/> 
Nakamoto wanted to base his new currency on that of gold or silver rather than the standard fiat currencies<sup>9</sup>. Fiat currencies can be reprinted and cause the value of the notes to fluctuate and cause inflation. When Nakamoto released his Bitcoin the world was in a recession caused by the corruption and irregularities in banking and so Nakamoto wanted to create a coin that could not be manipulated and would allow the value of bitcoin to constantly rise as the supply diminishes.<br/> <br/> 

<sup>7.</sup> BTC is the shorthand way of writing Bitcoin </br>
<sup>8.</sup> As of 09/09/2018 </br>
<sup>9.</sup> A fiat currency is a currency without intrinsic value, established as a payment system. </br>
### Limitations of the Bitcoin Blochchain
As explained above, Satoshi Nakamoto’s network takes 10 minutes to create a block and it is estimated that it can only manage seven transactions per second (TPS). Each individual transaction can take anywhere from 10 minutes to many days to be confirmed. Indeed, the timings depend on the amount of hash power available on the network at the point of transacting. This volatility in transaction time makes it difficult to imagine a day when a consumer could use Bitcoin to pay quickly for a take-away coffee for instance, limiting the use of Bitcoin as a cryptocurrency. (Blockchain speeds & the scalability debate, 2018) <br/> <br/> 
![Average Confirmation Time](/images/limitations-of-blockchain.png)
Another major problem with Bitcoin blockchain is its environmental impact. Due to the mathematical algorithm used to validate transactions in the Bitcoin blockchain (called Proof of Work), the Bitcoin mining process uses a huge computational power. According to Digiconomist, worldwide Bitcoin mining requires more energy that the whole of the Czech Republic needs (Bitcoin Energy Consumption Index). This negative environmental impact has been well documented in the press, with some journalists going as far as describing Bitcoin Mining as an “climate threat” (Hern, 2018).<br/> <br/> 
Ultimately, Bitcoin as a cryptocurrency might not last because mining for it will become too expensive and/or the computing power will become insufficient to back-up transactions, slowing the whole network down to a stop. The financial speculation around the price of a Bitcoin also has a negative impact: how can goods and services be valued in bitcoins if the actual Bitcoin value varies so much? Thus, Bitcoins were valued at nearly $20,000 in December 2017 but fell to $6,000 in September 2018 (Bitcoin (USD) Price). If Bitcoins become useless as a digital currency, will the technology behind them also lapse?  <br/> <br/> 

### Conclusion

Satoshi Nakamoto’s original aim was to simplify online transactions by bypassing governments’ control of currencies. However, in writing the protocol for Bitcoin, he/she laid the ground work for other types of blockchains. Bitcoins might turn out to be another “bubble” which will burst in due time, but the technology behind it will survive<sup>10</sup>. Indeed, Blockchain is not just about cryptocurrencies or monetary transactions. Blockchain is the operating system, and Bitcoin is only one of the many applications that can be run on that system. Bitcoin can be compared to the Ford Model T car produced in the 1900s, and Blockchain to its engine (Elnaj, 2018). Blockchain technology is here to stay: it will evolve and power many more marvellous inventions.   <br/> <br/>
